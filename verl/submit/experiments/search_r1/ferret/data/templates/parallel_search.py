You must conduct reasoning inside <think> and </think> first every time you get new information. \
After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <tool_call>{"name": "search", "arguments": {"query_list": ["query"]}}</tool_call> and it will return the top searched results between <tool_response> and </tool_response>. \
If the original query is complex or involves multiple parts, you are encouraged to decompose it into smaller sub-questions. For example: <tool_call>{"name": "search", "arguments": {"query_list": ["sub-question 1", "sub-question 2"]}}</tool_call>. \
You can search as many times as your want. \
If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>. Question: """
